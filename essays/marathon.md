### Running the wrong marathon

Last November a good friend of mine ran his first marathon. He'd been training for months. Whenever we met up, I'd ask him how the training was going. He'd tell me about the long runs, the sore muscles,  the dietary restrictions, the early mornings. He tracked everything in an app. Each week he saw he was making progress. 

I went to see him run the marathon. It was an ideal day for running, crisp and partly cloudy. We made a banner and waited for him at the 7 mile mark, which happened to be a few blocks from my apartment in Brooklyn. The corner of 3rd and 3rd was packed with spectators. I've seen the NYC marathon several times and am always struck by the diversity of the runners. There are people of all ages, shapes, sizes, and abilities. As a spectator, you feel the impulse to cheer and high-five every runner who passes by.

Watching the marathon is one of those moments that makes you proud to be a New Yorker. The whole city shuts down for a half a day and comes out to watch. Millions of dollars are raised for charity. When the race is over, the party moves from the streets to the bars and afterparties. The endorphins are infectious.

All of this left me with a very strong desire to run the marathon next year. I've considered it many times. But then I thought about it some more ... and I realized that marathons are actually pretty stupid.

### Why marathons are overrated

Marathons are a ridiculous time commitment. Most marathon plans are 16-20 weeks and require 4-6 hours of training per week. That's about 100 hours total. It is almost comparable to being a part-time college student.

Moreover, the payoff in terms of improved strength, flexibility, or even cardiovascular health isn't all that great. I'm not saying that marathons are net-negative in any of these areas. Just that long-distance running is less effective at boosting overall health than most other serious fitness activities like yoga, swimming, rock climbing, kickboxing, weightlifting, etc. And these activities require a much smaller time commitment. 

There are also some studies linking marathon running to increased risk of arthritis, stress fractures, heart damage, and a weakened immune system. I won't get into the specifics, but there's a growing body of evidence that marathon running can have adverse effects on certain health dimensions.

My last gripe is that the distance of 26.2 miles or 49.195 km is completely arbitrary. The long route from Marathon to Athens, Greece is only about 25 miles (~40 km) long. This was the distance of the first Olympic marathon in 1896. At least that distance had some historical significance. However, the distance was extended in 1908 to 26.2 miles to accommodate Queen Alexandra's request that the race start on the lawn of Windsor Castle and finish in front of the royal box at the Olympic stadium. 26.2 miles is a stupid, forgettable, practically irrational arbitrary number. At least the recommended distance of 10,000 steps per day is a nice, memorable, round arbitrary number.

So, marathons are exceptionally time-consuming, not exceptionally good for health, and wholly arbitrary. Why do we love them? 

We love marathons because they give us a black and white goal to achieve AND we know that this goal can only be achieved by putting in steady, compounding work. If you are a novice runner, there is no shortcut to going from 5K to 25K. You need to put in the hours. After every long run, you feel the burn in your legs -- and you know you have to do a bit more next week. It's a constant feedback loop. Because the gains are compounding, once you do your first 10K, it seems inconceivable that a 5K could ever have been a challenge. For goal-oriented folks, logging steady incremental progress is a helluva drug. 

Equally important is the fact that marathons are events that participants have to sign up for a given marathon months in advance. A non-negotiable deadline takes away the excuses. A non-negotiable deliverable -- it's the same 26.2 miles for everyone -- forces you to stay on track. These hard requirements, combined with the accountability and social pressure that comes from telling all your friends, family, and coworkers that you are running a marathon, make it hard to renege on your commitment.

These are the reasons our brains convince us to love marathons.

Putting in continuous effort towards something exceptionally hard is the right reason to run a marathon. It should be cause for celebration.

But most of us are running the wrong marathon. We are literally running the wrong marathon if our desire is to be healthier and our strategy is to run 26.2 miles. More often, we are running the wrong marathon because we have a sense of something we want to accomplish but no system for tracking progress and staying accountable to putting in the work.

My guess is that, if surveyed, marathon runners would cite a range of personal motivations for why they are running a marathon. Unless they are an aspiring Olympian, the actual time it took for them to run 26.2 miles would be irrelevant to their goal. And there are likely countless more effective regimens for accomplishing their goal than running a marathon. 

The power of marathons is that they come with structure and accountability out of the box. We crave this structure and accountability whenever we set out to improve ourselves. We yearn for feedback loops and motivation to keep putting in steady progress even when it seems we've plateaued or regressed. 

Most of the good things in life are marathons, the result of tiny gains compounded over many, many iterations. Very few have an app or training plan to keep you on track, or a black-and-white deliverable that comes with a medal when you reach the finish line.

Running the right marathon means picking a worthy goal and constructing a system for measuring and staying accountable to steady progress. We're all capable of doing extraordinary things. Don't waste all your energy chasing an arbitrary number.
